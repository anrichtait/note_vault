# Problem requirements solving process:
## Requirements:
Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

Prototype: ```char *_strdup(char *str);```
The _strdup() function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string str. Memory for the new string is obtained with malloc, and can be freed with free.
Returns NULL if str = NULL
On success, the _strdup function returns a pointer to the duplicated string. It returns NULL if insufficient memory was available

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strdup [[string.h]]. Run man strdup to learn more.

## Analyse:
### Inputs: 
- char `*str`: string to copy to new location.

### Expected Output:
- Pointer to the new (copied) string.
- Null if insufficient memory was available.
