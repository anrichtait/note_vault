# Process:
## Requirements:
Write a function that concatenates two strings.
    Prototype: char *str_concat(char *s1, char *s2);
    The returned pointer should point to a newly allocated space in memory which contains the contents of s1, followed by the contents of s2, and null terminated
    if NULL is passed, treat it as an empty string
    The function should return NULL on failure

## Analyse:
### Inputs:
- `char *s1`: first string
- `char *s2`: second string

### Expected Output:
- NULL on failure
- Pointer to newly allocated space that contains concatenated copy of s1 and s2(null terminated).
